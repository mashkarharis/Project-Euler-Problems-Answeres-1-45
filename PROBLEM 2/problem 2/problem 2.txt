#QUESTION 2
#Even Fibonacci numbers
#Problem 2
#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

x=1
y=2
sum=0
print (x)
print (y)
while ((x+y)<4000000):
    z=(x+y)
    print (z)
    x=y
    y=z
    if (z%2==0):
        sum+=z
    else:
        sum+=0
print ("By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,  the sum of the even-valued terms is"),(sum+2)
#2 is from first y even-value
